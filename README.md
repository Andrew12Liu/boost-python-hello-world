A Most Basic Starter with `boost-python` using `homebrew`
======


# Assumptions

- Familiarity `python` as a minimum requirement
- Have `homebrew` installed
- `python 2.7`
- Vague `c/c++` knowledge i.e. be able to write a function - that's about it!
- Mac OS X - I used El Capitan 10.11.6 at the time of writing

# Get `boost-python`
You can obtain the correct `boost-python` through [`homebrew`](http://brew.sh/) via the command:

    brew install boost --with-python --build-from-source
	
I think `brew install boost` should work but it's a big install and life is short to do it twice
